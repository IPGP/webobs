A GRID is a group or network of elementary NODES. Each NODE can be associated to one or multiple GRIDS. There is three types of GRIDS:
<ul>
<li>a VIEW is a list of NODES we simply want to group to be seen or accessed together,</li>
<li>a PROC is a list of NODES associated to a common data processing that produces outputs (graphs
and/or elaborated data),</li>
<li>a FORM is a list of NODES with manual data in an editable database.</li>
</ul>
