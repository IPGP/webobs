function y = decim(x,r,method)
%DECIM	Fast data decimation.
%	DECIM(X,R) resamples data in vector X at 1/R times the original sample
%	rate, using the mean value of R consecutive samples. The resulting
%	resampled vector is R times shorter. If X is a matrix, it returns the
%	decimated vectors of each column.
%
%   DECIM(X,R,METHOD) uses one of the following METHOD for decimation:
%	    'mean' : mean value (default)
%	  'median' : median value
%	     'sum' : sum value
%	     'min' : minimum value
%	     'max' : maximum value
