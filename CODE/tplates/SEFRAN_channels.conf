# SEFRAN3 template channnels.conf file
#
# Definition of the SEFRAN3 channels (please use spaces as column delimiter):
#   - Alias: channel alias code for display
#   - Stream: channel stream full name (Network.Station.LocId.Channel)
#   - Sensitivity: sensitivity factor (in counts per m/s)
#   - Filter: applies a filter to the signal:
#                   [X]: constant offset value [X] (in count)
#                median: median value correction (formerly 'auto')
#                 trend: linear detrend correction
#                 sp[X]: spline filter using [X] seconds interval points
#                        ([X] is a positive integer)
#   [ft][fn][N],[F],[S]: digital filters
#                        ft = 'lp' (lowpass), 'hp' (highpass),
#                             'bp' (bandpass) or 'bs' (bandstop);
#                        fn = 'bu' (Butterworth), 'be' (Bessel),
#                             'c1' or 'c2' (Chebyshev type I or II);
#                         N = positive integer;
#                         F = frequency (in Hz), use [FL,FH] for 'bp'
#                             and 'bs' type;
#                         S = stopband attenuation/ripple (in dB) for
#                             Chebyshev only.
#   - PP: sets the signal amplitude peak-to-peak (in m/s), same value for all
#     channels is recommended.
#   - RGB: define the signal color (HTML format: hexa or standard name)
#     ATTENTION: for hexa format use double-quote "#FF0000" to avoid comment !
#   - Spectrogram: coma separated list of parameters W,Fmin,Fmax,scale
#                       W = time window step (seconds)
#                    Fmin = min frequency (Hz)
#                    Fmax = max frequency (Hz)
#                   scale = Y-scale: lin (linear) or log (logarithmic)
#     will use SGRAM_PARAMS values from SEFRAN3.conf when empty.
